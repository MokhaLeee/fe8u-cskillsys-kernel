Ah! What a pleasant surprise.[N]
General Valter.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Quite. What's the situation, Tirado? The[N]
bot still eludes you, does he?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me, General.[A] Prince Ephraim still fights[N]
in the lands north of Renvall.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Ohoho! Impressive.[A][N]
What happened to all those[N]
mercenaries you hired?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
They've proveb to be ...less than adequate.[A][N]
The boy is clever. His band strikes quickly[N]
and then vanishes into the woods.[A][N]
We outnumber him 10 to 1, and yet[N]
he uses the terrain wisely to fight us.[A][N]
The boy's reputation as General Duessel's[N]
student is well deserved.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hahahaha... how interesting.[A][N]
The lad's beginning to whet my appetite.[A][N]
Ah, I've just had quite the idea...[A][X]

[OpenMidLeft]
How are we on supplies[N]
and equipment?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yeeeeaah, it's not looking good.[A][N]
Our weapons are in bad shape,[N]
and we're running low on food.[A][N]
We could probably restock at a[N]
nearby village, but--[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, that's not an option.[A][N]
The risk or revealing our location or losing[N]
even one of you, is too great.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yeah, I knew you'd say that.[A][N]
I mean, it's because of stuff like that[N]
that we've survived this long.[A][N]
But eventually, we'll eed to face[N]
reality. What are we going to do?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
We've somehow managed to scrape by[N]
this long with what we've had, but...[A][N]
With our options fo retreat cut off, and[N]
no word from the capital...[A][N]
Our options seem very limited at the moment.[A][N]
Grado's advantage in this war is[N]
unquestionable.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not to worry.[A][N]
My father is in the capital[N]
and he won't surrender easily.[A][N]
Forde, Kyle...[N]
Our mission here has been to harry the[N]
troops, to distract their eye.[A][N]
Hopefully, we've been able to give my[N]
father and Eirika time to escape.[A][N]
We'll do one more decisive strike[N]
against the enemy, and then retreat.[A][N]
Kyle, have you heard anything[N]
from Orson?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
No word yet. It's about[N]
tme he returned actually...[A][N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_OrsonHealthy]
*Haah*... *haah*...[N]
Reporting in, Prince Ephraim.[A][N]
I can confirm Grado presence at[N]
several points around our camp.[A][N]
A large battalion of soldiers[N]
has been dispatched from Renvall.[A][N]
We ought not tarry here any longer[N]
than necessarry.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A][N]
Thank you for your efforts,[N]
Orson.[A][N]
Please, take this moment to rest.[A][N]
You've earned it.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Thank you, sire.[A][N]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Forde]
Well, you wanted to catch Grado's eye...[A][N]
And I'd say we've certainly[N]
done just that.[A][N]
What's the last place you want[N]
to hit?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Renvall.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Hahahaha![A][N]
Well, I'm glad you haven't[N]
forgotten how to crack a joke.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Seriously though...[N]
where should w--[A][N]
Sir? Guys? Where are you going?[A][N]
H-hold up, wait for me![N]
Did I miss something?![A][X]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Kyle]
[OpenMidLeft]
All right, let's go.[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]
Wait, no! ...[....]Are you[....][N]
sure you're quite sane, Prince?[A][N]
We have an entire army after us, and[N]
you want to hit their base?![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Forde! Watch your tongue! This[N]
is our prince you're addressing![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Kyle, please, it's all right.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
...Yes, my prince.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Returning to matter at hand.[A][N]
Renvall holds a relatively important place in[N]
Grado's national defense.[A][N]
I don't carry any illusions that[N]
we can hold it.[A][N]
But I recall coming here with Lyon[N]
and General Duessel once.[A][N]
If memory serves, there should be a[N]
hidden passage near the throne.[A][N]
It should take us a few miles west.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I understand what you're saying, but...[N]
can we really do it with our current strength?[A][N]
If Sir Orson was in his prime,[N]
maybe, but...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Every soldier in this area is[N]
trying to find us.[A][N]
The enemy has us vastly outnumbered.[A][N]
Attacking the castle is a ridicuolous[A][N]
If the enemy thinks the same, then[N]
we may have our opening.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I--I guess?[A] ...[....][N]
Well hey, we can't run forever,[N]
and a hidden passage sounds good.[A][N]
What've we got to lose?[A][N]
...Other than our lives and all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, if we don't move quickly, we[N]
may never get another chance.[A][N]
Let's get in, thrash about a bit, and[N]
then be off.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Yes, sir![A][X]

## Chapter_05x_Pre_Scene_04_Convo_01
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Zonta]
A-an attack? By Ephraim's troops?![.][A][N]
T-to arms! Prince Ephraim's circled around[N]
and brought the fight to us![A][N]
Why'd it have to happen when[.][N]
Sir Tirado and General Valter are away?![A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]if I capture the prince here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Then I'll be known as the Hero of Grado![A][N]
Get to it, men![.] Get me a promotion![A][X]

Yes[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] sorry for pushing you so hard.[A][N]
Your wounds have yet to heal, and[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Fear not, Highness.[A] [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Should it come to it, I am ever ready to[N]
lay down my life for you.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A] But please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A] don't.[A][X]
