...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's okay, you're safe now.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Wa....[A][N]
Waaaaaah![A][N]
I was so scared...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight]
Thank you, thank you![N]
Thank you so much![A][N]
You saved our lives![A][N]
I wish we could replay you[N]
sonehow, but...[A][N]
These wartime taxes have[N]
bled us near dry.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
! N-no, please.[N]
You were only in that situation because[N]
of use in the first place.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
T-that's not true at all, ma'am![N]
You were only passing by![A][N]
Well, we don't have much to offer,[N]
but please, stay the night.[A][N]
It is the least we can do.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I thank you for the offer,[N]
but... we must be off.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
If... if that is your wish...[A][N]
But please, if nothing else, have this.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace_Tana]
I'm glad that they're safe.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
As am I.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Tana? Is something wrong?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Eirika, are you okay...?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Hm? Oh, don't worry.[A][N]
I took a few blows, but[N]
Father Moulder looked to them.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I--I'm glad to hear that, but...[N]
that isn't what I meant.[A][N]
Eirika... we've traveled a long way now.[N]
We've helped a lot of people.[A][N]
Don't you think we should[N]
take a moment to rest?[A][N]
We haven't slept in a warm[N]
bed for weeks, now...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh...[N]
I'm so sorry, Tana.[A][N]
If you're tired, we can find[N]
an inn.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
There... you're doing it again, Eirika.[A][N]
This... this isn't about me![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
T-Tana...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know what you're trying to prove,[N]
but you have to stop![A][N]
Every time someone offers us[N]
a place to stay, you refuse![A][N]
Every time someone is in danger,[N]
you drop everything to help them![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Of course I do![A][N]
If I stay in a town,[N]
I endanger its citizens![A][N]
And... am I to ignore cries for help?[A][N]
Abandon the helpless in[N]
their time of need?[A][N]
I must do something![N]
You said it yourself![A][N]
If someone bad does bad things,[N]
you have to stop them![A][N]
That includes me as well, Tana![A][N]
All my life, all I've done is[N]
sit in a gilded tower...[A][N]
Unaware of the world[N]
around me![A][N]
I cannot let people suffer[N]
because of my selfishness.[A][N]
Because of this war that[N]
I carry responsibility for![A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
The only one who suffers because[N]
of you, is YOU, Eirika![A][N]
I don't care whose fault this[N]
war is, but I know it's not yours![A][N]
Can't you see that?![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
...! But I--![A][N][OpenEyes]
[OpenMidLeft]
I love your kind heart, Eirika![A][N]
I love that you always do your[N]
best for everyone you meet.[A][N]
But Eirika... you have to[N]
love yourself too![A][N]
It's not selfish,[N]
you're not a bad person.[A][N]
The fact that you're even[N]
thinking like this is proof of it![A][N]
So please, Eirika...[A][N]
It breaks my heart to[N]
see you like this...![A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft]
...sniff ...sniff[A][N][HalfCloseEyes]
I'm sorry I yelled...[A][N]
...[N]
I'll go see to my pegasus.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight]
...Okay.[A][X]

[OpenRight][LoadFace_Artur]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Natasha]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Moulder]
...Yes, I agree.[A][N]
Whatever their reasons, this is[N]
an affront to the heavens.[A][N]
But I wonder how they even[N]
came about such power...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenLeft]
Ah, Princess Eirika.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Oh... forgive me. I did[N]
not mean to interrupt.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Oh, it is no interruption,[N]
Your Highness.[A][N]
We were discussing Grado's undead.[N]
It is quite a curious issue.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Th-that is quite an understatement,[N]
Father Moulder.[A][N]
Whatever Grado are doing, it[N]
is an affront to all that is good.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...Brother Artur? I was[N]
wondering...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yes?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
We know now that Sister Natasha[N]
was telling the truth.[A][N]
Should you not return to your[N]
temple and report?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Ah. Well, I suppose[N]
I should, but...[A][N]
You are not yet reunited with[N]
your brother, Prince Ephraim.[A][N]
I cannot simply abandon[N]
you in your hour of need.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
But...[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Haha. Do not worry,[N]
Princess.[A][N]
It is the least I can do.[A][N]
Besides... I don't think I could pull[N]
Lute away from a journey such as this.[A][N]
Despite how bookish she might seem,[N]
she actually enjoys it all.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]
I am quite inclined to agree[N]
with Lady Lute.[A][N]
It does feel good to be able[N]
to apply action to my words.[A][N]
Traveling the countryside and aiding[N]
those in need...[A][N]
It is not something I could have[N]
done were I not with you.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]
Yes, I agree as well.[A][N]
And... Princess.[A][N]
I wanted to thank you.[A][N]
Ever since I left Grado, I...[N]
I was prepared to die, but..[A][N]
To be truthful, I was afraid.[A][N]
That the Stones would bless me[N]
so, that you were the one to find me...[A][N]
I am so grateful.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
I-I see.[A][N]
You're... welcome.[A][X]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace_Lute]
[OpenRight][LoadFace_Ross]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace_Neimi]
[OpenLeft]
...and that is why 'Za' is such a[N]
common prefix to those names.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Wow...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
That... is... so... COOL![A][N]
I had no idea stuff like that could[N]
be so cool.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Yes, you do seem the type[N]
to be ignorant of such matters.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
Thanks! That was a compliment,[N]
right?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Sure.[A][N]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace_Eirika]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh! Lady-Princess Eirika![N]
Please, have a seat![A][N]
Lute is telling us about so[N]
many interesting things.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Oh no... I am just[N]
making the rounds.[A][N]
Are you all okay after[N]
that last battle?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Uh-huh. We're all fine.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yeah, no problem.[A][N]
So Lute! Tell me more[N]
about magic stuff![A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...Why?[A] You clearly lack[N]
the aptitude to learn magic.[A][N]
Especially at my level.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
I don't want to cast magic![A][N]
I'm a fighter![A][N]
...But there's a lot more[N]
to fighting than fighting.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Truly earth-shattering wisdom.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Yeah![A][N]
Ever since me and Dad joined[N]
up with you, I've realized...[A][N]
Fighting isn't just about[N]
how strong you are![A][N]
Knowing the terrain, the enemy...[A][N]
Figuring out what battles you can win.[A][N]
So, thanks, Lady Eirika![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Huh? But I haven't[N]
done anything.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What? That's not true![A][N]
You're a SUPER good fighter![A][N]
Almost as good as my dad![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Th-that's not true at all.[N]
I'm not nearly as strong as he is.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, it's like Ross said,[N]
you know?[A][N]
It's not just about how good you[N]
are at swinging at axe or a sword.[A][N]
T-to be honest, um...[A][N]
Colm always complains[N]
that I cry too much...[A][N]
So I want to change![A][N]
A-and I've never see you cry,[N]
Eirika. Even though...[A][N]
Even though you've lost[N]
so much more![A][N]
You're a really big inspiration![A][N]
I-I think that...[A][N][MoveFarRight]
I...[N]
think you're really cool![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I-I'm sorry,[N]
Princess Eirika![A][N]
Th-that's not a real proper word,[N]
is it?[A][N]
And I'm sorry I forgot to call[N]
you Princess, I--[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
No, no![A][N]
It's okay, Neimi. You can call me[N]
whatever you'd like.[A][N]
Really, I...[N]
Thank you.[A][N]
I'm... really happy to hear[N]
that you think of me like that.[A][N]
[OpenRight][MoveRight]
Oh! Then, me too![A][N]
I also think you're really[N]
cool, Eirika.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Th-thank you, Ross.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Um, if it's all the same[N]
with you...[A][N]
I think I'll keep calling[N]
you Princess.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course, Lute.[A][X]

You alright, boy?[A][N]
Should we stop?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Haaaahh... haaaaahhhhh...[A][N]
No, I-I'll be fine. Please...[A][N]
I can keep going![A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
No.[A][N]
You need to pace yourself.[A][N]
Strength is gained through patience.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Indeed.[A][N]
I'm glad you're invested, but...[N]
that's enough sparring for one day.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Y-Yes sir![A][N]
...[A][N]
[OpenRight]
What's wrong?[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...it's nothing, really...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Out with it, Franz.[A][N]
You clearly have something[N]
you want to let out.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
...Sometimes, I think...[A][N]
Sometimes, I think it would have been[N]
better if I had stayed back.[A][N]
By King Fado's side.[A][N]
Why... am I so weak,[N]
why... why am I here?[A][N]
Why couldn't someone more worthy[N]
be at the Princess's side...?[A][N]
[OpenRight]
...[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
Survivor's guilt, then.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
S-Sir Gilliam?[A][N]
[OpenFarRight]
I'm not surprised.[A][N]
It happens to the best of us.[A][N]
[OpenRight]
Mhm.[A][N]
I fear I can do litte to help[N]
heal those wounds, Franz.[A][N]
All I can do is assure you...[N]
they will heal with time.[A][N]
Know that it is everyone's wish[N]
that you stay here with us.[A][N]
[OpenLeft]
Y-Yes! Sir Garcia... Sir Gilliam...[A][N]
Thank you.[A][N]
